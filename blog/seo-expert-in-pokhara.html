            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1. How long does it take to see SEO results in Pokhara?
            </h3>
            <p>SEO results typically begin appearing within 3-6 months for local searches in Pokhara. However,
                significant improvements in rankings and traffic often require 6-12 months of consistent optimization
                efforts. Local SEO improvements through Google Business Profile optimization can show results within 4-8
                weeks.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Should I use Nepali or English keywords for my Pokhara business?
            </h3>
            <p>The optimal strategy incorporates both English and Nepali keywords based on your target audience.
                Tourism-focused businesses should prioritize English keywords, while service providers targeting local
                customers should emphasize Nepali keywords. A balanced approach typically delivers the best results.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. What mobile SEO practices matter most for Pokhara businesses?
            </h3>
            <p>Mobile optimization is critical in Pokhara's mobile-first market. Focus on fast loading times, responsive
                design, easy navigation, click-to-call buttons, and mobile-friendly booking systems. Ensure your website
                loads quickly even on slower 3G connections common in Nepal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. How important are online reviews for Pokhara businesses?
            </h3>
            <p>Online reviews significantly impact local search rankings and customer decisions in Pokhara. Actively
                encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews, respond professionally to all feedback, and maintain a
                rating above 4.0 stars. Reviews in both English and Nepali can enhance your local authority.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Can I do SEO myself, or should I hire a professional?
            </h3>
            <p>While basic SEO principles can be learned, effective SEO requires ongoing expertise, time, and technical
                knowledge. Professional SEO services provide strategic advantage, especially in competitive markets like
                Pokhara's tourism industry. Consider the opportunity cost of time spent learning versus focusing on your
                core business operations.
